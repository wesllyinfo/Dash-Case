# Data Analytics Projects
Data analytics projects involve collecting, analyzing, and interpreting large sets of data to uncover insights and inform decision-making. 

These projects often involve the use of tools such as Excel, SQL, Power Bi, Looker Studio (Formerly Google Data Studion) and programming languages like Python and R to manipulate, visualize, and model the data. 

The goal of a data analytics project is to extract useful information from raw data and use it to improve business processes, inform strategy, and drive growth. 

Some common types of data analytics projects include customer segmentation, predictive modeling, and A/B testing.
